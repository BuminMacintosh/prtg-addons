= Introduction =

This tool can be used in combination with PTF sensors that require a users password to be entered in the sensors settings section. The !PassHash can be used instead off the given password. 

= Details =

Using the !PassHash instead off the password, passwords are not visible as plain text in the sensors settings section.

= Example =
{{{
-u=mydomain\john -p=mysecretpassword -f="c:\file location\log.txt" -s="String to search"
}}}
Can now also be entered as
{{{
-u=mydomain\john -p=h:a1Nrr0UeurEznxXov0LM3RrPhK7jeajH -f="c:\file location\log.txt" -s="String to search"
}}}
