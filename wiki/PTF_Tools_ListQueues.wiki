= Introduction =

!ListQueues is a tool to show MSMQ's and !PrintQueues on a given Windows computer.

= Details =

PRTG's sensors x and y need the queue name to be entered in the sensors settings.

As these queue names are not always that obvious, this tool helps you to determine the correct queue name.
