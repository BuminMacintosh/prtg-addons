= Introduction =

!ListQueues is a tool to show MSMQ's, !PrintQueues and Scheduled Tasks on a given Windows computer.

= Details =

PRTG's sensors *Windows MSMQ Queue Length* and *Windows Print Queue* need the queue name to be entered in the sensors settings.

As these queue names are not always that obvious, this tool helps you to determine the correct queue name.
