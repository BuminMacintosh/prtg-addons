With PTF.!MediaStreamer you can have your PRTG Server monitor media streams.

There are two separate applications in the download:
 * *!MediaStreamer x.x.x setup.exe* is a setup file for the !MediaStreamer application that constantly monitors your streams. 
 * *!MediaStream.exe* is the PRTG sensor that reports the results to your PRTG Server.

==Prerequisites==

The following prerequisites apply for the !MediaStreamer and the !MediaStreamXML sensor. For the !MediaStreamer, please make sure these are installed on the target computer before installing the !MediaStreamer.

*!MediaStreamer (application)*
 * .NET Framework 3.5
 * Microsoft Media Player
 * Adobe Flash Player
 * VLC Player 2.0
*MediaStreamXML (sensor)*
 * .NET Framework 2.0

==PTF !MediaStreamer==

The PTF !MediaStreamer runs on a Windows workstation and does the actual monitoring of the various streams. Run the !MediaStreamer x.x.x setup.exe  to install the !MediaStreamer application on your PRTG server or any other Windows machine in your network. After installing the application, use the action buttons to Add, Edit and Delete steams. You can monitor any number of Media Player, Flash, VLC and JWL streams. The Play button can be used to test a stream.

==Timed Checks==

The !MediaStreamer autonomic ally checks the streams using the various time settings and stores the results in the “C:\PRTG Tools Family\PTF.!MediaStream” folder of the machine that runs the !MediaStreamer.
The settings window gives you the option to schedule your checks based on days of the week and a from/until time. You can also determine how many checks can be performed simultaneously, preventing system overload and saving bandwidth.

==PTF MediaStreamXML==

The !MediaStreamXML.exe is the PRTG sensor that reads the results from the “C:\PRTG Tools Family\PTF.!MediaStream” folder of the machine that runs the !MediaStreamer.

==Adding the sensor==

Copy the !MediaStreamXML.exe file to the “\Custom Sensors\EXEXML” folder of your PRTG installation. Next, connect to your PRTG server using the web interface and choose to add a new sensor to the device of your choice.
