With PTF.!MediaStreamer you can have your PRTG Server monitor media streams.

The download consists in two .exe files:
 * *!MediaStreamer.exe* is an application that constantly monitors your streams and 
 * *!MediaStream.exe* is the Custom Sensor that queries the !MediaStreamer and reports the result to your PRTG Server.

Install the !MediaStreamer on a Windows Computer and add a number of Media Players and/or Flash Players
