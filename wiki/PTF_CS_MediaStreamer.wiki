With PTF.!MediaStreamer you can have your PRTG Server monitor media streams.

There are two separate applications in the download:
 * *!MediaStreamer x.x.x setup.exe* is a setup file for the !MediaStreamer application that constantly monitors your streams. 
 * *!MediaStream.exe* is the PRTG sensor that reports the results to your PRTG Server.

Install the !MediaStreamer on a Windows Computer and add a number of Media Players and/or Flash Players
